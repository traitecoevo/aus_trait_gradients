# Paper about the Austraits compilation

This is the R project used to analyse the data and produce figures for the manuscript titled "Revisiting the role of mean annual precipitation in shaping functional trait distributions at a continental scale".

Running the analysis pre-packaged

To run the analysis, run the file Aus_traits_gradients.Rproj. Then, open code.Rmd to view the script, run the analysis and produce figures and tibles.

The script is mostly self-contained, and will reproduce the results in the manuscript because the traits and climate data are stored as .RDS files, which are small in size and can be transferred easily. Moreover, the austraits package allows Austraits to be downloaded easily for use.

The only thing that needs to be done manually is to include the Bioclim raster layers into the folder climate_data/wc2.1_30s_bio to ensure that Figure 1 and certain supplementary figures can run.

Modifying the analysis

However, if you do want to modify the analysis, it may be necessary to download a number of files:

- Trait data is obtained from Austraits: this data is automatically downloaded when running the script code.Rmd using the `austraits` package using the function austraits::load_austraits(version = "4.1.0").

- Climate data must also be downloaded due the large file sizes, but cannot be downloaded via R.
Information about where to access climate files is available in the code.Rmd but is also detailed here.
	-The standard Bioclim variables are availalbe here: (https://biogeo.ucdavis.edu/data/worldclim/v2.1/base/wc2.1_30s_bio.zip). This link directly downloads the zip file containing all 19 variables at 30sec resolution. Unzip the downloaded folder, then drag the files into the empty folder data/climate_data/wc2.1_30s_bio
	
	-The ENVIREM variables are available here (https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/data/concern/data_sets/gt54kn05f). Download the .zip folder titled Australia_current_30arcsec_geotiff_set1.zip then drag the following file: current_30arcsec_annualPET.tif, into the empty folder climate_data/Envirem
	
	 
	-The CHELSA monthly VPD climatologies (1981-2010) are available here: https://envicloud.wsl.ch/#/?prefix=chelsa%2Fchelsa_V2%2FGLOBAL%2F. Navigate to climatologies/1981-2010/vpd/ and download all contained files. Then drag the files into the empty folder climate_data/VPD_Chelsa. 
	
	-The boundary file for Australia is downloaded from here: https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files, under `Australia - 2021 - Shapefile`.
